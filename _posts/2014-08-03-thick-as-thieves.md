My travel journal</div>

I'm currently in the city [Munich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) for my
second internship with [google](http://google.com). I decided to keep a small
notebook as a travel journal. 

But from time to time, I might want to share a little something with the world.
Such an example is today, where I learned how to unsuccessfully open a door with
a credit card. I was eating ice cream with
[@mrsminirobot](https://twitter.com/mrsminirobot) and her friend Alice (name
redacted for anonymity) today at the [Mad Ice Cream
Maker](https://www.facebook.com/dERvERRUECKTEeISMACHER) to get over the fact
that Alice had locked herself out of her apartment. Unfortunately it didn't
help, because apparently you can't sleep on ice cream. Since the door wasn't
actually locked, there was still the possibility of the door opening to a credit
card attack. I'd post a youtube video, but none prepared us for the fact that
most front doors are not that easily accessible and you actually have to get
around the edge of the door. The algorithm is the following:

1. Get your credit rating in shape enough to get your hand on a credit card.

2. Use a hair dryer to bend the credit card into a L-shape. Actually you shouldn't
   have bothered with the credit rating and used something that is easier
   replaced. ![Hair dryer vs credit card](/static/images/credit-card2.svg)
3. [Press card to door.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC9n-0GAhRQ)
4. Hit door until something happens.

Unfortunately German doors are not as flimsy as American doors seem to be, so
we failed miserably because the corner between door and lock was to big. But
hey, this is still a nice trick if it actually works!
