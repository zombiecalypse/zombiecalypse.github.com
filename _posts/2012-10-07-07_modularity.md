*This article is part of the [Sinatra Story]({% post_url 2012-10-09-sinatra_story %}) series.*

Look at [the code of the last iteration](https://github.com/zombiecalypse/SinatraStory/tree/master/iteration05).

Up to this point, we just threw new classes, new models, new tests, and new
routes into a few files. This works for small projects, but in a team it is
*very* problematic if everybody works on the same files. So lets change that!

One file should solve one problem. Usually that means that there is exactly one
class in it, but with routes, it could look a bit different.

We notice some changes, that we could do:

* Split the `models.rb` file into a `text.rb` and an `user.rb`
* Split the `controller.rb` into an `authentication.rb` and a
  `text_controller.rb`.
* Split the `tests.rb` into `user_test.rb` and `server_test.rb`.

This seems simple enough and it turns out, aside from the second point, it
really is.

## Model
So lets first take the model:

```ruby
# models.rb
require 'rubygems'
require 'bcrypt'

class Text
  ...
end

class User
  ...
end
```

So we can split this up into:

```ruby
# app/models/text.rb
module Models
  class Text
    ...
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
require 'rubygems'
require 'bcrypt'

module Models
  class User
    ...
  end
end
```

* You can define name spaces with `module`. You could also add another name
  space with your application name.

Now instead of including `models`, we would include `app/models/user.rb` or
`app/models/text.rb`. Because of the name space, we would need to access the
classes via `Models::User`, which is very cumbersome, so we `include` the
`Models` name space into the active one to get that out of the way.

## Tests
We had one test file, that included everything from everywhere. We can transform

```ruby
# tests.rb
def relative(path) { ... }

# includes all models:
  require relative('controller.rb')

# only used by server test:
  require 'rack/test'

  include Rack::Test::Methods

describe User do
  ...
end

describe "Server" do
  ...
end
```

can be transformed into

```ruby
# user_test.rb
def relative(path) { ... }

# explicit about includes:
  require relative('../app/model/user.rb')
  require relative('../app/model/text.rb')

# include module
  include Models

describe User do
  ...
end

# server_test.rb
def relative(path) { ... }

# This time, we need the text controller:
  require relative('../app/controller/text_controller.rb')

require 'rack/test'

include Rack::Test::Methods
include Controllers

describe "Server" do
  ...
end
``` 

## Controllers

This is actually a bit more difficult. If you looked at the 
[Sinatra documentation](http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation), there are two
ways of doing things: The classic approach, that we took before and the modular.
With the modular approach, we define modules (actually classes) for controllers
and can then plug them together.

First of all, the `require 'sinatra'` has to go, it sets up everything for a
classic application, something we explicitly don't want it to do.  Instead, we
define controller classes, that inherit from `Sinatra::Base` in the
`sinatra/base` file. But surely, we need some configuration constants, like
for example the location of the `views` folder. For this, place the following
in the root directory and include it in every file:

```ruby
# config.rb
...
Views = relative('views')
```

Fortunately the `get`, `post`, and `delete` definitions are relatively easy to
take appart into the different classes, so we can define

```ruby
module Controllers
  class Authentication < Sinatra::Base
    module Helpers
      def user
        @user
      end
    end

    helpers Sinatra::ContentFor
    helpers Helpers
    set :views, Views
    ...


  end
end
```

* You typically need to include the helper methods of extensions with
  `helpers`. The argument must be a module, not a class.
* The `views` folder must be set manually. If this bothers you, you can write
  a minimal subclass of `Sinatra::Base` that does exactly this and subclass
  every of your controllers from that.
* The `@user` variable is not visible from outside this class, but the
  `#user` method can be used. It must be packed into a module, that can later
  be included via `helpers`.

The `TextController` will use some things of the Authentication controller,
namely the `user`. Be sure to include the `authentication.rb` and then declare
the `Authentication` helpers.

```ruby
# text_controller.rb

class TextController < Sinatra::Base
  helpers Sinatra::ContentFor
  helpers Authentication::Helpers
  set :views, Views
  ...
end
```

Finally, you need to edit all the views and replace `@user` with `user`.

In the `main.rb` file at the root of your directory, you need to include all
controllers and define a main application which uses the other classes.
Finally, you run that class.

```ruby
class Main < Sinatra::Base
  enable :sessions
  set :views, Views
  use Controllers::Authentication
  use Controllers::TextController

  get("/") { redirect to("/text") }
end

Main.run!
```

Try it, fix the errors, repeat, but this should allow you to make modular
Sinatra applications. You should also consider to move views for different
controllers into different folders, you can do that with `:'path/to/view'` in
the controller. Have fun!
