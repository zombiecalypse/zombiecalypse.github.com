I noticed recently that it became harder and harder to keep a habit of creative
writing in parallel to my studies and working. It was pretty easy during high
school, but my expectations and to few free time left me with little ideas that
I would put down on paper. A fun thing about creativity is that while you might
think it thrives most with absolute freedom, the opposite is true (see for
example viharts video [12 tones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4niz8TfY794), a
30min well spent).  An easy way to trick your brain to think of something
worthwhile is to set some kind of task like

    Write a riddle that has XYZ as a solution.

or

    Write a short poem that begins with the words XYZ.

Of course it is more interesting if the containt is not completely under your control.

Here is a [small script](https://github.com/zombiecalypse/CreativeConstraints)
that produces random tasks. For example:

<pre class="task">
</pre>
